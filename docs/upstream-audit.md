# Standalone Cadre upstream audit

Baseline: `elie222/rakazo` commit `f17887a2724d6cd457abe406a17c4c8721d0c013`. The fork preserves its Pi agent runtime, bot/thread model, persistent computer UI, file and browser tools, model selector, routines, groups, and native clients. This inventory covers every changed or added tracked path against that baseline at this release.

## Corrections

The public domain previously served a different Hermes application. It now points to this Cadre fork. Making Company OS the only hosted login was an unjustified first-run dependency; production now uses the original email/password account flow (`AUTH_PROVIDER=local`). Company OS credentials do not activate an integration when that mode is selected, and its Workforce entry is hidden. Those optional modules remain dormant to preserve prior work; they are not prerequisites for a bot, model, computer, or task. No Company OS development is included in this correction.

On hosted installations, a configured deployment model skips provider setup. The user names a first bot and sends a message using the existing composer. Cloudflare, Modal, model credentials, job dispatch, and workspace persistence are service configuration. The customer does not deploy an external agent, assemble a fleet, or supply a model key.

The shared light background was warm off-white in upstream. Explicit product direction now sets white/black foundations and neutral grays; sans-serif UI typography and upstream structure remain. Responsive fixes preserve the original desktop shell while fixing mobile navigation, touch targets, composer overlap, and draft handoff.

Saved workspaces download and restore in bounded parallel batches to avoid serial per-file latency on wake.

The Linux desktop retains the upstream window manager and adds a file manager, text editor, development utilities and launcher dock. The noVNC viewer adds direct phone keyboard input and clipboard controls while retaining its native pointer handling. Hosted voice can use an optional server credential; its customer UI has no key fields.

The hosted screen gateway permits module imports from the isolated viewer origin without forwarding application credentials. Manual computer control uses the user control grant independently of an active agent run. On phones, the computer button opens the existing full-screen viewer. Hosted accounts do not expose the model API-key settings.

The paid marketing template is a separate licensed site, not a replacement application shell. Its source is retained privately; the public repository only has a routing boundary and branding.

The continuity update adds optional native filesystem snapshot caches backed by the portable home, batched Modal file transfers, separate bot displays and a stop/reconnect correction. Shell arguments preserve the executor's per-bot working directory when the model omits `cwd`. No marketing routes, components or licensed source are changed.
